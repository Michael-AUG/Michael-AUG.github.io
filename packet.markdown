**I currently hold five FACs under my licence for packet nodes.**
* GB7AUG (Newton Mearns) for 2m
* GB7AUG (ditto.) for 4m - not yet in operation
* GB7AUG (ditto.) for 40m
* MB7NKL (Kilsyth) for 2m
* MB7NKL (ditto.) for 4m - soon to be in operation

The GB7AUG node setup is thoroughly explained below. The Kilsyth (MB7NKL) node has a near identical setup to the 2m GB7AUG node (with the substitution of the Diamond X-2000 for a Diamond X-50N). Together MB7NKL and GB7NDH (run by Nathan MM3NDH) link the cities of Glasgow and Edinburgh by packet radio - meaning I have achieved my aim of linking these two cities! Before the regulations changed, I was also SYSOP for MB7NDH.

**GB7AUG**

I run a AX.25 Packet Node and Mailbox (at 1200bd), callsign GB7AUG, serving the Glasgow and East Renfrewshire areas. This node operates on 2m (144.9375MHz). I currently handle mail for regions 72 (Central), 73 (Dumfries and Galloway) and 78 (Strathclyde). I also have a FAC for a 40m port on the node, allowing me to carry mail up and down to/from England. This uses 300bd I2LP+CRC and sits at a dial freq of 7.0468MHz.

I use a two NinoTNCs, produced by Nino KK4HEJ, to run GB7AUG. I bought the kit to make the NinoTNC as part of a group buy for interested members of OARC - the Online Amateur Radio Community. When I get 4m running at GB7AUG I will use a NinoTNC for this too.

The software that runs the nodes is linbpq, a Linux version of the famous bpq32 software developed by G8BPQ.

In terms of radio hardware, the 2m transceiver is a Tait TM8110, an excellent ex-PMR radio. My antenna is Diamond X-2000, with excellent coverage over Glasgow and the Clyde, as well as into Renfrewshire, Ayrshire and parts of Lanarkshire.

My current HF transceiver is an Icom IC7300, but I hope to replace this with an Icom IC7100 when it is returned from repair. I have a Tait TM-8110 low-band VHF transceiver lined up for 4m packet use.

**OARC Packet Network**

*Following a successful TNC group buy, OARC members (and others) are attempting to re-establish a UK-wide packet network primarily using amateur RF. Since the arrival of the NinoTNCs, new packet nodes and ports have sprung up, and the project is rapidly gaining momentum.*

Although Packet Networking has seemed to fade into obscurity over the last few decades, as the above shows, there has been a resurgance in interest in this fascinating and technically complex yet rewarding mode. Thanks to the hard work of, among others, Tom M0LTE (who co-ordinates the OARC Packet Network project), we have been able to map the packet nodes in the UK. You can [access this map by clicking here](https://nodes.ukpacketradio.network/packet-network-map.html). 

My node is a work in progress, and every day I am learning more about how AX.25 Packet Networking works. It is also stretching and strengthening my Linux command line skills, which can only be a good thing too.

If you are in the area, please do connect to GB7AUG on 2m; or if you connect to a node near to you, have a look and see if there is already a connection to mine in place!
