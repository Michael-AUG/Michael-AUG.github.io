This site deals mainly with my amateur radio activity, but please [click here](https://www.topple.scot/) to view my Blog, or [here](https://michaelrjtopple.academia.edu/) to view my profile on Academia.

My interest in Amateur Radio began when I was fifteen, after a visit to the [National Radio Centre](http://www.nationalradiocentre.com/) at Bletchley Park in Milton Keynes, England. After having a go on the radio there, I was hooked, and took my Foundation exam about two months later, gaining the callsign M6EIO with the Colchester Radio Amateurs (CRA). My first radio was a borrowed Icom IC-706 Mk1. In November 2013 I sat and passed my Intermediate Exam and took the callsign 2E0GUI.

Studies, exams, work and life intervened and, although I remained interested in radio, I spent about two years (2015-17) inactive on air. In this time I moved to, and returned from, South Wales. Having returned I found employment and once again took up the hobby. I met and fell in love with Jackie, marrying her in August 2021. Jackie and I moved from Colchester to Glasgow in January 2022 as I took up my studies at the University of Glasgow, operating initially as 2M0GUI.

Nearly ten years after gaining my Intermediate licence, on 13th March 2023, I (finally!) sat and passed my Full exam, taking the callsign GM5AUG a couple of days later. I was pleased to be able to choose the three letters at the end of my call, and chose them in memory of Ron G4AUG, now S/K, who features throughout this website. You can read more about how I came in to Amateur Radio in the [My Journey](https://gm5aug.topple.scot/journey/) page. Around this time I officially surrendered my Foundation and Intermediate callsigns, from then on operating solely as GM5AUG.

In my spare time, I enjoy researching vintage or antique Amateur Radio ephemera, a selection of which may be viewed in the [File Store](http://44.31.241.193/). I often update this so do check back every now and then. Those interested in Amateur Radio history may find [this link](http://www.g4kfk.co.uk/) of interest, while [this link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p0b0yl8p) goes to a fascinating BBC documentary about the early days of broadcasting and [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZ7kmdh6LU&list=WL&index=9) to a BBC Radio 4 documentary about amateur radio.

I'm licensed as [**VP8EBL**](https://www.qrz.com/db/vp8ebl) on the Falkland Islands and intend to operate there on my future visit.

I continue to learn, get pleasure, have fun, and relax in the Amateur Radio hobby, enjoying working primarily on HF, but also occasionally on VHF and UHF. Ordinarily I use CW but also sometimes enjoy voice modes. Maybe weâ€™ll work each other some day, if not already. My QRZ page is not especially interesting as it just links back here, but I do keep this page largely up to date. 

Please QSL either directly or via the Bureau. QSL cards happily sent on request.

*Michael sailing, one of his other hobbies, which he doesn't get chance to do nearly enough.*
When sailing I also serve as 'Radio Officer', having taken my VHF SRC Exam, and holding a Licence to Operate.
