One aspect of amateur radio that I particularly enjoy is contesting. Although not a 'serious' player owing to my limited set-up, I frequently enter contests (especially CW contests) and enjoy trying to optimise both my station and my operation to get the best score possible.

I was introduced to contesting by Jonathan G0DVJ, and have taken part in contests both with him and also as part of the Colchester Contest Group (VHF).

*Michael wins 1st place in Scotland and 4th place in Europe in the 2022 CQ WW WPX (CW) Contest - note the better score than 2023 owing to a) more time spent in the contest and b) operating under the youth category.*
