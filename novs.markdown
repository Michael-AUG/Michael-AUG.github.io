Since first being licenced in 2012, I have operated under a number of NoVs. NoVs are 'Notices of Variation', allowing the operator to vary his callsign or the terms of his licence. NoVs fall into four main categories[^1]:
[^1]: Note these are my designations only and not official category types.

1. Regional Secondary Location NoVs
2. Special Event Station NoVs (only available to Full licensees)
3. Variation of a licence to operate on different frequencies (only available to Full licensees)
4. I have a NoV to allow me to broadcast the GB2RS News - (only available to registered GB2RS Newsreaders)

I have made use all of the above types of NoVs. A few of the variations from groups 1 and 2[^1] are listed below, with links to QRZ pages.
