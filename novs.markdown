Since first being licenced in 2012, I have operated under a number of NoVs. NoVs are 'Notices of Variation', allowing the operator to vary his callsign or the terms of his licence. For ease I have split NoVs into four main categories, but these are my designations only and not official. For more information, [please click here](https://rsgb.org/main/operating/licensing-novs-visitors/online-nov-application/) to visit the RSGB NoV page.

Four categories of NoVs:

1. Regional Secondary Location NoVs
2. Special Event Station NoVs (only available to Full licensees)
3. Variation of a licence to operate on different frequencies (only available to Full licensees).
  3a. Here there are also NoVs for running nodes, repeaters, [packet mailboxes](https://gm5aug.topple.scot/packet), etc
4. I have a NoV to allow me to broadcast the GB2RS News - (only available to registered GB2RS Newsreaders)

I have made use all of the above types of NoVs. A few of the variations from groups 1 and 2 are listed below, with links to QRZ pages.

In March and April 2023 I operated GB5AAW in Autism Awareness Week. The event organiser, James Gallo (KB2FMH), described Autism Awareness Week as "the biggest special event in Ham Radio history" - and it was an honour to be a part of it. It was through this special event that I met my dear friend, Colin GM4JPZ.
