Below is a link that will display a map of the planes that my Raspberry Pi is currently tracking over my parents' house in JO01LV. I feed these plane spots into the excellent OARC ADS-B application, which can [be found here](https://adsb.oarc.uk/).

[Click here to view the map view of the aeroplanes over Colchester](http://82.30.4.254:108/tar1090/?&zoom=9.5)

I have tried to embed this view in an <iframe>, but because the map display (using tar1090) is served with http, and this website is served with https, the <iframe> doesn't work. This is a work in progress, though!

For more information about the work of OARC (The Online Amateur Radio Community), [visit their website](https://www.oarc.uk/)

In time I plan to add more to this subpage, so please check back.
