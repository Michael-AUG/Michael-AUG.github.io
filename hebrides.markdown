Between Friday 26th April to Friday 4th May, along with my friend Kevan 2M0WMG I will be active from the Outer Hebrides. IOTA Ref EU-010. We will mainly be active from the islands of Barra, Eriskay, South Uist, Benbecula and North Uist as well as a few smaller tidal islands along the way if the WX is kind. 

On Monday 29th April (exact times TBC) we will be operating from the island of Fiaray, also spelt Fiaraidh from the WAB square NF61 which has not previously been activated. On the afternoon of Sunday 28th April we plan to operate from the NF80 square on Eriskay which has also never been activated. 

We will also be operating from the Parks On The Air park of South Uist Machair Scenic Site. POTA reference GB-0973 at various times between Sunday 28th and Monday 29th April. Nearer the time and providing phone signal allows while we are there we will post updates to our Twitter/X account but bear in mind the Outer Hebrides weather can be unpredictable and wild at the best of times which may disrupt things.

We will also be on 2m and 70cms FM and SSB looking for SOTA stations, 4m FM and the FM LEO Satellites. I will mainly be using CW and Kevan will be mainly on HF SSB although may dabble in a bit of PSK.
