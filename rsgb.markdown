I am pleased to be a member of the Radio Society of Great Britain (since 2012) and firmly believe in 'giving back' to the amateur radio hobby. For this reason I volunteer for the RSGB in a variety of ways:
<br>
##District Representative
<br>**I am DR13 (District Representative, District 13) for the RSGB, covering Ayrshire, Dumfries and Galloway. To contact me in my role as DR13, please email [dr13@rsgb.org.uk](mailto:dr13@rsgb.org.uk).**

##Morse Assessing

**I am an RSGB approved Morse Assessor, offering Morse testing for those wishing to take the RSGB official [Certificate of Competency](https://rsgb.org/main/operating/morse/certificate-of-competency/)**
<br><br>
##Morse Broadcasts
![GB2CW broadcaster](images/gb2cw.png)
**I am a volunteer broadcaster for the RSGB's GB2CW scheme, offering QRS Morse code broadcasts for general reception. The GB2CW licence allows for broadcasting (something the amateur licence doesn't allow for) meaning that anyone, licensed or otherwise, can tune in and practice their copy.**
You can find the GB2CW Broadcast Schedule [by clicking here](https://rsgb.org/main/operating/morse/certificate-of-competency/gb2cw-broadcast-schedule/)
