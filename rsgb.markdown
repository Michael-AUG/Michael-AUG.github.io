I am pleased to be a member of the Radio Society of Great Britain and firmly believe in 'giving back' to the amateur radio hobby. For this reason I volunteer for the RSGB in a variety of ways:

<br>*Since moving to Scotland I have begun a GB2RS broadcast on a Sunday evening. GB2RS is the News Broadcasting service of the RSGB and began way back in 1955 with Mr Frank Hicks-Arnold negotiating with the GPO to be allowed to* **broadcast** *the News, something that the normal amateur licence didn't then, and doesn't now, allow. I broadcast on 145.525MHz FM at 1830hz on a Sunday.*

*I mainly operate in CW (Morse Code) and was pleased to take and pass the RSGB's Morse Proficiency Tests at 12, 15 and 20wpm. Since then I have been appointed an RSGB Approved Morse Code Assessor (for others wishing to take the exams), and provide three **GB2CW** broadcasts a week: Sundays at 1930hz on 3555kHz or 7066kHz (A1A and J3E - +/- for QRM), and on Mondays and Thursdays at 2000hz on 144.600MHz (F2A and F3E).*
