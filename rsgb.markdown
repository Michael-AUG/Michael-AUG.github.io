I am pleased to be a member of the Radio Society of Great Britain and firmly believe in 'giving back' to the amateur radio hobby. For this reason I volunteer for the RSGB in a variety of ways:

*I mainly operate in CW (Morse Code) and was pleased to take and pass the RSGB's Morse Proficiency Tests at 12, 15, 20 and 25wpm. Since then I have been appointed an RSGB Approved Morse Code Assessor (for others wishing to take the exams)*
