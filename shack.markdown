*The operating 'bench'*

As mentioned elsewhere, my first radio was an Icom IC-706 Mk1, borrowed from the Colchester Club upon passing my Foundation exam. This led me to use Icom equipment, something I still do today.

My main radio in the shack is an Icom IC-7100, this giving me 100w output across the HF bands, 50w on 2m and 35w on 70cms.  I have made an End Fed Long Wire antenna (with a 9:1 UnUn) which tunes, with relative ease, across from 160m to 6m. For VHF I use a metal 'Slim Jim' antenna. My QTH being high above the city of Glasgow gives me good coverage on 2m, allowing me to be well heard for my GB2RS and GB2CW broadcasts, and for running the Glasgow University Wireless Society Nets. Aside from these, I don't often use VHF, normally using HF, and CW at that.

I've found that, as I've only got a limited station, CW offers my best chance of making interesting QSOs with assorted DX. While I've got nothing against those who like/love them, I've never got in to FT8, FT4, JS8Call and the like - but I still get a thrill of a CW contact!

My key, an MFJ-564 Iambic paddle, once belonged to S/K Gavin Nesbitt (MM1BXF) who died tragically young. While I didn't know him intimately, he and I used to chat via text/phonecall quite frequently, and he was very encouraging towards me getting my Full licence.

*My power and SWR meter - on loan from G0DVJ!*

Using an EFLW has many advantages, such as ease and practicality (one wire can cover the whole HF part of the spectrum), but also risks introducing a few problems - these include getting unwanted RF in the shack, and relying on an Antenna Matching Unit to 'fool' the rig into putting out full TX power. My tuner, pictured above (below Jonathan G0DVJ's loaned power and SWR meter) is an LDG IT-100 Autotuner and works extremely well and making my antenna and rig 'play nicely' together. Having the meter in-line also allows me to keep an eye on my transmit power levels and SWR levels. Often the meter is the first sign of an issue, so is well worth having. In time I hope to be able to run more power into a better antenna, but for now the two factors precluding that are 1) money! and 2) living in rented accomodation.
