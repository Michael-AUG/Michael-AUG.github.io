A few people have said how nice it was that, in former versions of this webpage, I mentioned Ron and the influence he had on my Amateur Radio journey. Given that I have quite a few of his amateur radio effects, I thought I would share some information about him on here.

Ron was born in London in 1930 and, after a short time working as a Warehouseman, performed his National Service in the RAF, operating RADAR systems. On being demobbed he had a number of jobs, before finally becoming a Fireman in his native Loughton.

Ron sat his City and Guild Amateur Radio exam in 1970, receiving the following **pass slip**:

Subsequently, his **City and Guilds certificate**, familiar to many radio hams, arrived. This he displayed with pride on his shack wall for the next forty five years:

Some eighteen months later, Ron took his Morse Test (then a compulsory element of the Amateur Radio licence) at 12wpm, receiving this **Morse Test pass slip**. This would allow him to move from a VHF only licence (also known as a Class B licence) to a Class A licence. Sadly I don't know what his Class B callsign was.

Shortly after taking his Morse Exam (according to the datemark, on the same day - did he take his exam at the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications Office in London?), Ron was sent this **letter confirming his Class A Amateur Radio licence**. He had been given the callsign G4 AUG - this call he would use for the next four and a half decades.

With this letter, or perhaps some time after, Ron received his **Amateur Radio Certificate** which, alongside his RAE Certificate (above), hung on the wall of his shack for many years to come:

Over the next few decades, Ron would be involved with the [Loughton and Epping Forest ARS](https://www.lefars.org.uk/). Here he made many friends and was a regular at the Club nights. One member recalls that he was known for working Top Band mobile (I hate to think how he managed that!). As this letter, sent to me by Dave Thorpe G4FKI, shows, Ron was keen to encourage folk into the hobby and share his wisdom and advice:

In later life, Ron and his XYL, Eileen, moved to Colchester, and it was there that I met them through Church. Ron was a real encouragement to me as a, then, newly licenced M6EIO. Over the next few years he and I would often chat radio, visit each other's houses, and speak on air. 

Ron's self-designed QSL card didn't change in the forty or so years he was licenced. The top image was sent to me by Dave Thorpe, and the bottom image was a QSL card Ron sent me. Ever one to make use of what was around, note how he just updated his old cards with his new address:

Ron became a silent key in 2017. It is my privilege to follow his G4 AUG call as GM5 AUG. As you'll see from my 'Vintage Equipment' page, much of his equipment is still used as well. He was a credit to the hobby, and I was privileged to be his friend.
