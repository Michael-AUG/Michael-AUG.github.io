I studied Computer Science at College and, although it has been a number of years since I was using it regularly, I did build up a reasonable knowledge of certain programming languages. Since moving to the Linux ecosystem I have rekindled my interest in programming, writing scripts and applications to speed up or simplify certain tasks.

An example of this is the F2A Morse Rigctld script I have written, which integrates the ['morse' application](https://gitlab.com/esr/morse-classic) with the rig control functions [(rigctl) of Hamlib](https://github.com/Hamlib/Hamlib). This enables me to send evenly sped Morse Code over FM for my 2m GB2CW broadcasts.

Another little project I worked on was a script, controlled by a monentary switch attached to the GPIO pins on my Pi, to restart a couple of services. As I use my Pi for radio logging, it is important I can quickly restart these services when needed. For more information, [see here](https://github.com/Michael-AUG/RestartLog).

You can find these, and various other projects I have worked on, on [my GitHub page](https://github.com/Michael-AUG). I am grateful to various people for helping me with my projects, not limited to Mitch AB4MW, Torin MM1STK and Tom M0LTE. I am certainly still an 'amateur' coder but enjoy it when a piece of code speeds up or simplifies my life. 

As well as Bash scripting, I have also learned Markdown and have used that to create this website entirely in the Nano Terminal text editor. See below:
