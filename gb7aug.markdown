*Technical details of GB7AUG Packet Node*

I run a AX.25 Packet Node and Mailbox (at 1200bd), callsign GB7AUG, serving the Glasgow and East Renfrewshire areas. This node operates on 2m (144.9375MHz), and is linked to a couple of  other nodes using AXIP technology. In time I am considering moving this over to 4800bd and the IL2P protocol. I currently handle mail for regions 72 (Central), 73 (Dumfries and Galloway) and 78 (Strathclyde). I am in the process of applying for a NoV to add a 40m port to my node, allowing me to carry mail up and down to/from England.

For a TNC, I use a NinoTNC, produced by Nino KK4HEJ. I bought the kit to make the NinoTNC as part of a group buy for interested members of OARC - the Online Amateur Radio Community.

The software that controls the TNC is LinBPQ, a Linux version of the famous software developed by G8 BPQ.

In terms of radio hardware, the transceiver is a Tait TM8110. My antenna is a 2m Slim Jim at rooftop level, with excellent coverage over Glasgow and the Clyde, as well as into Renfrewshire, Ayrshire  and parts of Lanarkshire.

**OARC Packet Network**

*Following a successful TNC group buy, OARC members (and others) are attempting to re-establish a UK-wide packet network primarily using amateur RF. Since the arrival of the NinoTNCs, new packet nodes and ports have sprung up, and the project is rapidly gaining momentum.*

Although Packet Networking has seemed to fade into obscurity over the last few decades, as the above shows, there has been a resurgance in interest in this fascinating and technically complex yet rewarding mode. Thanks to the hard work of, among others, Tom M0LTE (who co-ordinates the OARC Packet Network project), we have been able to map the packet nodes in the UK. You can [access this map by clicking here](https://packetnodes.spots.radio/etcc-packet-map.html). 

My node is a work in progress, and every day I am learning more about how AX.25 Packet Networking works. It is also stretching and strengthening my Linux command line skills, which can only be a good thing too.

If you are in the area, please do connect to GB7AUG on 2m; or if you connect to a node near to you, have a look and see if there is already a connection in place!
