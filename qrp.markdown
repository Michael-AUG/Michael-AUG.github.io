While most of my operating takes place at home (see my Shack page), I do enjoy taking my QRP radio out portable. There are a variety of locations that I've used over the years, whether on my own or with other amateurs. Two relatively recent examples of these were with Kevan (2E0WMG), who made videos of our adventures. You can view the videos below:

* [Xiegu-Fest and Working USA on 1 Watt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iizjUnknKbU)
* [Top band in the dark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4xrpUkOefg)

It was with Kevan that I visited the Hebrides in spring 2024 for a radio adventure. For more information see the "Hebrides 2024" page above.

<br>*The Heathkit HW-8*

Another resident in my radio shack is this 1978 Heathkit HW-8 QRP transceiver. These rigs have a cult following in amateur radio owing to their simplicity, popularity and price. Giving between 2.5w to 3.5w INPUT on the 80m, 40m, 20m and 15m amateur bands, this rig is a lovely example of highly technical, yet compact, 70s radio technology. My rig is a little 'QRH' (the frequency can vary!) but I am hoping to be able to remedy this (and a few other issues) before too long. I will normally sign '/QRP' when using this rig as it produces less than 5w. More information can be found at [RigPix - Heathkit HW-8](https://www.rigpix.com/heathkit/hw8.htm) or the [HW-8 Handbook](http://www.radiomanual.info/schemi/Surplus_Radioamateur/Heathkit_HW-8_handbook_2ed_2008.pdf). I've already managed to work a few stations using 'Hetty' and look forward to working others.

## VHF and UHF Operation

My V/UHF radios (aside from those used for packet nodes)
* A [VGC VR-N76](https://www.hamradio.co.uk/vgc-vr-n76-aprs-handheld-radio-2m-70cm) - my go-to handheld now, with a built in KISS TNC and APRS function. An excellent wee radio.
* An older Kenpro KT-22 2m FM HT (see below)
* A couple of ubiquotous Baofeng UV-5Rs (ideal for loaning to people)
* A Quansheng UV-K5 with the egzumer firmware (not used so much now, but often used to listen to the marine VHF channels)
* A Yaesu FT-290R (although this is not in GWO)

![Kenpro KT-22](images/kenpro.jpg)
*Kenpro KT-22 2m FM Transceiver*

My **Kenpro KT-22** - from 1990. This transceiver produces either 1.5W or 150mW, is equipped to work with +/- 600kHz repeater shifts, and has a 1750Hz toneburst button. 

![SOTA Operation](images/sota.jpg)

A little while ago, a former friend kindly gave me his old 2m SOTABeam, and this has given me many hours of pleasure as well. Photograph above shows me operating atop Corse Hill (GM/SS-236). I take my Kenpro (above) on these trips, and it is amazing how far 1.5W will get when a) it is directed and b) you have height on your side! The below map illustrates this - each dot on the map shows a station I worked from the hilltop!
