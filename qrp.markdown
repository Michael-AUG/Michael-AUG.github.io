title: QRP and Portable

While most of my operating takes place at home (see my Shack page), I do enjoy taking my QRP radio out portable. There are a variety of locations that I've used over the years, whether on my own or with other amateurs.

Until fairly recently, I would take my shack Icom IC-7100 out and about with me, keeping it in a briefcase that I modified for purpose. However I wasn't particularly comfortable with this setup, so with some Christmas money was able to buy a wee Xiegu G106 QRP radio. This radio, which provides between 5-10W of CW, SSB or AM, is compact enough to fit into a small satchel, along with a battery, AMU, key and roll of wire for an antenna.

By way of a demonstration, below are recordings taken from various WebSDRs, showing how well a low power transmission can be heard around the world.

## VHF and UHF Operation

When /Mobile in the car, I use a **Kenwood TM-D710**, a V/UHF Dual Bander which gives 50W output on both 2m and 70cm. With it I use a 5/8Î» whip attached to a Mag-Mount.

![Baofeng UV-5R](images/baofeng.jpg)
<br>*Stock image of a Baofeng UV-5R*

As do so many other amateurs, I have a couple of the **Baofeng** dual band range of handheld transceivers - a **UV-5R and a UV-5R Plus**. One of these is currently on loan to newly licensed MM7LWS.

*Kenpro KT-22 2m FM Transceiver*

I also use this vintage 2m handheld transceiver - a **Kenpro KT-22** - from 1990. This transceiver produces either 1.5W or 150mW, is equipped to work with +/- 600kHz repeater shifts, and has a 1750Hz toneburst button. 

See the below review from *Practical Wireless* (November 1990)

![Yaesu FT-290R](images/yaesu.jpg)
*Yaesu FT-290R 2m Transceiver*

My latest purchase is this vintage 2m transceiver, made by Yaesu in 1982. Producing either 2.5W or 500mW of USB/LSB/CW/FM, the rig is powered by eight C-cell batteries, or an external power supply. Neatly the rig has its own telescopic whip included, alongside the option to use an external antenna. While I have not used it in 'anger' yet, I look forward to doing so - particularly as this radio has a CW and SSB mode, something many portable 2m rigs do not have.
