**Today is Sunday - the Christian Sabbath**

On Sunday, Christians particularly recall Jesus' rising from the dead. Because of this, Sunday is set aside as a day of worship and praise, rest and family time. 
Because of this, I don't play on the radio on the Lord's Day, so this website is closed to help you to observe the Sabbath as well.

*Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.*
*Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:*
*But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work.*
(From Exodus 20. 8-10)
